# Code snippet. Minimal project : manipulating array of objects
Project written for with P5.js library : Minimal project for manipulating objects stored in an array.

## Handling multiple objects in an array
Handling multiple objects in an array of objects is a frequent and important part of object-oriented programming. 

Here is a minimal program to illustrate object handling with P5.js. The program automatically generates 20 rectangles of different sizes and colours. These are the properties of each 'rectangle' object.

Each rectangle is therefore an object, they are all registered when they are created in the array "rectangles = []". Each element of the array, thus each rectangle, can be manipulated individually thanks to the methods of the "rectangle.js" class. Clicking on a rectangle calls the 'delete' method which deletes the rectangle(s) under the mouse pointer. Double-clicking on the canva creates a new rectangle.
